# Human Activity Recognition Using Sensor Data for Fitness Tracking

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify human activities (such as walking, running, sitting, etc.) based on sensor data collected from fitness tracking devices. The dataset consists of accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings from different body parts like the torso, arms, and legs.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately recognize various physical activities, providing insights into personal fitness habits. This technology has applications in fitness tracking, healthcare monitoring, and sports analytics.

## Key features of this project:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using sensor data.
- **Machine Learning Model** for activity classification.
- A **Streamlit Web Application** that allows users to upload their own sensor data and receive real-time activity predictions.
- **Interactive Visualizations** using Plotly to explore sensor data trends and patterns.

This project demonstrates the potential for wearable devices and sensor data to improve health and fitness tracking by delivering actionable insights and real-time feedback on physical activities.
